forall:
    Iterates the commands in a do block over all the files
    matching a given regex recursively.  You can put anything
    you'd put in a normal target in the do block to be executed,
    and when it is executed the 'var' variable is set to the
    full path of each file.  This will also be in each task
    you transition to with the 'needs' command.

    forall assumes that you want the variable to be 'file'
    so for most tasks you can leave that option out.  If you
    nest forall expressions then you'll need to give each one
    a different name (just like in a real language).

    Usage: forall(files "*.py" var "file" do [ ... ])
